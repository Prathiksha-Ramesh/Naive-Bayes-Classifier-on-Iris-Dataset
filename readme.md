# Project Title: Naive Bayes Classifier on Iris Dataset

## Overview

This project demonstrates the process of using the Naive Bayes classifier on the Iris dataset. The goal is to provide a comprehensive example of how to implement and evaluate a Naive Bayes classifier for a classification task using the Iris dataset.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required packages using the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The required packages are listed in the requirements.txt file:

- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- pandas

## Usage
1. Data Preparation: The notebook uses the Iris dataset from `sklearn.datasets`.

2. Running the Notebook: Open the `notebook.ipynb` file to follow the step-by-step process.

## Steps in the Notebook:

1. Import Libraries:

Import necessary libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, and `scikit-learn`.
2. Load Dataset:

Load the Iris dataset using `load_iris` from `sklearn.datasets`.
3. Split Data:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`.
4. Train Naive Bayes Classifier:

Train a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier on the training data.
5. Evaluate Model:

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as `accuracy`, `classification report`, and `confusion matrix`.
